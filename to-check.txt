Frontend can’t reliably talk to backend

Because the Azure Static Web App has no linked backend and
your backend container is on a separate ACI instance.
CORS issues, mixed content errors, or failed API calls.
Deployment is fragmented
Frontend and backend are on separate CI/CD pipelines, 
so the frontend may point to an old backend URL if you redeploy the backend.

Manual intervention required
You are manually updating api.js or waiting for FQDNs, 
which is tedious and error-prone.
