🔧 TECHNICAL NOTES
==================

Integration Architecture:
- **Frontend:** HTML/CSS/JS with enhanced API client (/frontend/js/api.js)
- **Backend:** Django REST API with 15+ endpoints
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL with SSL encryption and connection pooling
- **Authentication:** JWT tokens with automatic refresh
- **Real-time:** Auto-refresh dashboard every 30 seconds
- **File Storage:** Django media storage with PostgreSQL metadata

Environment Setup:
```bash
# Start integrated backend server (Development)
cd backend
source venv/bin/activate
python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000 --settings=safesend.settings.development

# Deploy to Azure (Production)
cd /home/untitled/Documents/lunara.io
./azure-deploy.sh

# Access fully integrated application
Development Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
Production Frontend: https://safesend-prod-frontend.azurestaticapps.net
Backend API: https://safesend-prod-backend.azurewebsites.net
Dashboard: (after login)
Admin: /admin/ (admin@safesend.com / admin123!)
```

Test the Complete Integration:
- Login: testuser@example.com / testpass123
- Dashboard: Live stats from PostgreSQL (2 active, 1 completed projects)
- Real-time: Dashboard auto-refreshes every 30 seconds
- Persistence: All data survives page refreshes and server restarts

Admin Access:
- Email: admin@safesend.com
- Password: admin123!
- Django Admin: Full access to PostgreSQL data

API Endpoints (All Working):
- Authentication: /api/auth/login/, /api/auth/register/, /api/auth/logout/
- Dashboard: /api/auth/dashboard/stats/ (real-time PostgreSQL data)
- Projects: /api/projects/, /api/projects/my_projects/
- Files: /api/projects/{id}/files/upload/, /api/projects/{id}/files/

API Integration Pattern:
```javascript
// Include JWT token in requests
headers: {
  'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}`,
  'Content-Type': 'application/json'
}
```

⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS
======================

1. All frontend pages are production-ready - DO NOT break existing functionality
2. Backend API is fully tested - integration should be straightforward
3. CSP headers are configured for security - maintain these settings
4. Toast notifications use vertical stacking - preserve this behavior
5. All images use crossorigin attributes - don't remove these
6. Console is clean - avoid adding debug statements to production
