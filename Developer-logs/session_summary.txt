  Environment Setup Commands

  # Start backend server
  cd backend
  source venv/bin/activate
  python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8000

  # Access application
  Frontend: http://127.0.0.1:8000/
  API: http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/

  }

  // Automatic token refresh on 401 errors
  // User redirected to login if refresh fails

  📋 Summary for Next Developer

  You now have a fully functional REST API backend connected to your existing frontend. The login
  system works, project management is implemented, and the foundation is solid for rapid feature
  development. The next session should focus on completing the frontend integration and preparing
  for Azure deployment.

  Test the current implementation by visiting http://127.0.0.1:8000/signin.html and using the test
  credentials provided above.

● Changes have been committed to master branch (commit aa66639) and the comprehensive summary above
  covers everything implemented in this session. The backend API system is fully functional and
  ready for the next development phase.
