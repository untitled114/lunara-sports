# Architecture Decision Records

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the Play-by-Play project.

ADRs document significant architectural choices along with their context and consequences. We follow the [Michael Nygard format](https://cognitect.com/blog/2011/11/15/documenting-architecture-decisions).
